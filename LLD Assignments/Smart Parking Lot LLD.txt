Data Model:


Tables:
- ParkingSpots:
  - ID (Primary Key)
  - SpotNumber
  - Floor
  - Size (e.g., motorcycle, car, bus)
  - Availability (Boolean)
- Vehicles:
  - ID (Primary Key)
  - PlateNumber
  - Size
  - CheckInTime
- ParkingTransactions:
  - ID (Primary Key)
  - VehicleID (Foreign Key)
  - CheckInTime
  - CheckOutTime
  - Duration
  - Fee


 2. Algorithm for Spot Allocation:


 Algorithm:
1. When a vehicle enters:
   - Query the database for available parking spots based on size and floor.
   - Select the nearest available spot if multiple spots are available.
   - Assign the spot to the vehicle.
   - Update the availability of the spot in the database.
2. If no spots are available:
   - Display a message indicating the parking lot is full.


 3. Fee Calculation Logic:


 Logic:
1. Calculate the duration of stay based on the check-in and check-out times.
2. Determine the fee according to the duration and vehicle type:
   - Base fee per hour for each vehicle type.
   - Additional fees for exceeding a certain duration.
3. Apply any discounts or special rates (e.g., early bird discounts, monthly passes).
4. Update the ParkingTransactions table with the calculated fee.


 4. Concurrency Handling:


 Techniques:
1. Use database transactions for atomicity:
   - Begin a transaction before updating any related tables.
   - Commit the transaction after all updates are successful.
   - Rollback the transaction if any operation fails.
2. Implement locking mechanisms to prevent race conditions:
   - Use row-level or table-level locks to ensure data integrity during concurrent operations.


 Additional Components:


1. APIs or Services:
   - Implement RESTful APIs or microservices to interact with the database.
   - APIs for CRUD operations on parking spots, vehicles, and transactions.
2. Real-time Messaging System:
   - Use a message broker (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ) for real-time updates on parking spot availability.
   - Publish events when vehicles enter or exit the parking lot.
3. Logging and Monitoring:
   - Log system events, errors, and performance metrics.
   - Monitor system health, resource usage, and database performance.


 Scalability Considerations:


1. Horizontal Scaling:
   - Deploy multiple instances of the backend service to handle increased load.
   - Use load balancers to distribute incoming traffic across instances.
2. Database Sharding:
   - Shard the database to distribute data across multiple nodes.
   - Use techniques such as range-based or hash-based sharding to evenly distribute data.


 Deployment Architecture:


1. Backend Servers:
   - Deploy backend servers in a cloud environment (e.g., AWS, Azure).
   - Use containerization (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes) for easy deployment and scalability.
2. Database:
   - Choose a database system that supports high availability and scalability (e.g., PostgreSQL with replication, MongoDB with sharding).
3. Message Broker:
   - Deploy a message broker (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ) for real-time messaging and event-driven architecture.


 Security Considerations:


1. Authentication and Authorization:
   - Implement authentication mechanisms (e.g., JWT, OAuth) to authenticate users accessing the system.
   - Define roles and permissions to control access to sensitive operations (e.g., admin functions).
2. Data Encryption:
   - Encrypt sensitive data (e.g., user credentials, transaction details) in transit and at rest.
   - Use SSL/TLS for encrypting data in transit and encryption at the database level for data at rest.


 Disaster Recovery and High Availability:


1. Backup and Restore:
   - Implement regular backups of the database to prevent data loss in case of system failure.
   - Test backup and restore procedures periodically to ensure data integrity.
2. High Availability Architecture:
   - Deploy redundant components (e.g., load balancers, database replicas) to ensure high availability.
   - Use failover mechanisms to automatically switch to backup components in case of failure.
